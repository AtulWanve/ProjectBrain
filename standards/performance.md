# Performance Standards

## Bundle Size

- Keep initial JS bundle under 150 KB (gzipped)
- Use dynamic imports for route-level code splitting
- Tree-shake unused exports
- Avoid large libraries for trivial utilities

## Rendering

- Use server components by default in Next.js
- Stream responses with `loading.tsx` and Suspense boundaries
- Memoize expensive computations
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders

## Network

- Minimize API calls; batch when possible
- Use HTTP caching headers
- Compress responses (Brotli / Gzip)
- Implement pagination for large datasets

## Database

- Index query columns
- Use database-side pagination (LIMIT/OFFSET or cursor-based)
- N+1 query detection and prevention
- Connection pooling for production

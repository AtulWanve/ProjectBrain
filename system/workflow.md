> [!info] Knowledge Sync runs only when the review is accepted; rejected results bypass it and return to Execution or escalate. No implementation logic should exist inside this file. It is a high-level map. See the [[runtime/orchestrator|Orchestrator]] for the full deterministic pipeline with retry, escalation, and error handling.
